                  work mostly in Bournemouth, whilst hopping to and from Belfast, Northern Ireland
                  (where I'm from). Before I started out building websites, chatbots and apps, I
                  was working as a chef in the french alps.
                </p>
                <p className="aboutParagraph">
                  Yep, you read that right. A pretty huge career change, but i pulled it off. I
                  was cooking fine dishes by day, and learning to code and build sites initially
                  for friends and colleagues by night. Having taken all of those learnings from
                  the mountains, I packed the snowboard up, swapped my chef knives for coding
                  tools and headed to Bournemouth where I’ve been now for a number of years.
                </p>
                <p className="aboutParagraph">
                  Since I left working in the mountains, I have collaborated with some of
                  Bournemouth’s most exciting start-ups, agencies and studios. In doing so, I have
                  been fortunate enough to work next to some of the brightest tech minds the south
                  has to offer, and i like to think some of their brilliance has rubbed off on me
                  too.
                </p>

                <p className="aboutParagraph">
                  My long running thought is that I have always wanted to go out on my own and
                  work with a number of SME’s to help them bring to life their digital projects,
                  websites and conversational chatbots that help them to stand out amongst the
                  bigger brands.

                  Creative flair is something I have long since held, having worked as a chef and
                  then latterly as a developer. So I have got a keen eye for those all important
                  design touches that can help make a website stand out and engage its user base.

                  Whilst working as a Chef, I realised I have a strong passion for teaching
                  people. I always found myself helping out any new members of staff and teaching
                  them how to do certain dishes/techniques. This give me a huge sense of
                  achievement/joy/pleasure.
                </p>
                <p className="aboutParagraph">
                  When I was living in the Alps I had friends and family come out to visit me on
                  holiday. It was great to see them and spend time with them. I always ended up
                  being the snowboard / ski instructor for the week. It gave me such joy to share
                  my knowledge and see their progression.
                </p>
                <p className="aboutParagraph">
                  Learning to code has enabled me to combine the 2 passions I have in life,
                  Learning everyday and sharing my knowledge with others.
