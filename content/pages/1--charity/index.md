Hello! If you are new to this, then "Charity Tuesday" is an initiative of mine where I offer my skills and services to charities or non-profit organisations in and around Poole / Bounemouth. I do this on the first Tuesday of every month.

### What is it?

The charities I work for will have my skills and expertise, in house for 8 hours. I’ll advise, critique and generally help out with Web Design, Web Development, SEO and all things digital.

I am looking for new charities to work with in 2019, and help them with their online presence. If you work for a charity, or know someone who does, please get in touch.

### Why am I doing it?

I wnat to show smaller charities that they need to embrace digital technologies – whether it be responsive web design, mobile apps, or simply keeping a blog up to date. Lots of charities, for instance, want to know how to get their site ranking higher on Google or need to know how they can improve their social media range. I’ll cover a little bit of everything.

If you’d like to make use of my skills on a Tuesday, then please contact me as soon as possible and I’ll check my diary for the next available Tuesday.
