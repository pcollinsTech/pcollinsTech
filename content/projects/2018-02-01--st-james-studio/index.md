Will, the founder of St James Studio approached me to create a new website, from which he could display the work they do for their clients. The brief was to be sleek, cool, fresh and clean â€“ and the design has definitely achieved that. Using a very simple, yet elegant UI (user interface), coupled with bespoke product photography that really jumps out of the page, this site is beautiful and useable.
